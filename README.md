## Screenshots:
- Plotted graphs of channels 1,2, and 3, respectively. Screenshots of different cases such as all trials, zoomed part of all trials, till trial 1000, and till trial 11320 to include two actions. Each case has a screenshot of the raw and another of the filtered values.

## Challenges:
- Tracing and using the proper data structures while integrating different tools and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, is indeed confusing and challenging.
- Plotting the graphs were very consuming for Excel to process and graph. Taking much time to plot and edit the graph. The slightest, even scrolling, made Excel freeze for like a minute at least.
